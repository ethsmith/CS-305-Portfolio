## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial consulting company that creates tailored financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. They wanted to modernize their operations by implementing best practices and security procedures for their software. I was brought in to review and change their software to implement those best practices and security procedures as well as submit detailed reports for my findings.

## What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?

I believe I did the implementation of hashing algorithms rather well. It is important to code securely to prevent data from being stolen from the company or its customers. Software security builds trust with the clients and protects the companies finances.

## What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The part of the vulnerability assessment process that I found most helpful was learning how to check the dependencies we use in our software for security vulnerabilites. A lot of the time when we write software we tend to use other peoples libraries to speed up the development and we worry more about what meets our requirements the best and give little thought to the exploits we may be adding to our systems.

## How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

I approached the increasing layers of security but taking things one step at a time and doing proper research before I made final decisions. I made my decisions based on the decisions of other high security companies and their security practices. I will use the dependency check strategy as well as my new found knowledge on secure encryption algorithms in the future.

## How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I compliled the software application and ran tests to make sure that the code was secure. After refactoring the code, I would re-run the dependency checks and do more tests to make sure that new vulnerabilities were not found.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I believe that the most useful resources and tools that I used that I can could use in future tasks was the algorithm APIs within Java as well as the maven build system.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I want to show case my understanding of how to find vulnerabilities in my software and how I can make plans to fix vulnerabilities and prevent exploits.
